            Keep these baked garlic parmesan chicken wings crispy by parboiling the wings in a flavorful liquid, which helps season the chicken <br> and produce a surface texture in the oven that your guests will swear came straight out of a deep fryer. Serve with creamy Italian dressing for dipping.
